# cda_data_project

Code for the expanded capstone project with data simulation.

## data simulation

Using the CausalPowerAnalysis code

Data definition of files used are in the define_simdata().  These correspond to
files that are generated by the simulate_data.py in my fork of CausalPowerAnalysis
https://github.com/lelandwilliams/CausalPowerAnalysis.  My fork is here:
https://github.com/kelvinlim/CausalPowerAnalysis

To use the code, I downloaded picause.py from the github repository.

## Notes for csci5465 project

Code for my csci5465 project.  This project will use the jpype interface
to tetrad to speed up processing compared with using causal-cmd.

Possible scenarios are to do analysis of the effect of
number of samples in ema analysis by comparing the graphs with the
full dataset and different percentages of sampling such as
90%, 80% 70%, 60%, 50%.

It would be possible to do this 100 times at each sampling and
compare the metrics.  The proposed metric would be to use the
Dice coefficient.

Some cases to use with fges

Stored in data directory

1. sub_1019 has 118 rows and 13(direct)/15 edges
2. sub_1008 has 100 rows and 7(direct)/13 edges
3. sub_1033 has 93 rows and  10(direct)/10 edges
4. sub_1112 has 89 rows and 9(direct)/15 edges

## code for stats

run_stats.ipynb

## support for miceforest

Needed the libgomp library.

```
# macos
brew install libomp

# ubuntu
sudo apt-get install libgomp1
```

## Windows installation

Installed java jdk21

For PowerShell to set JAVA_HOME and set path

```
$env:JAVA_HOME = "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21"
$env:Path += ";$env:JAVA_HOME\bin"
echo $env:JAVA_HOME
```

For VA Azure virtual desktop

```
$env:JAVA_HOME = "R:\DVBIC\jdk21.0.4_7"
$env:Path += ";$env:JAVA_HOME\bin"
echo $env:JAVA_HOME

```

Also need the py-tetrad code, mainly for the tetrad jar file

git clone https://github.com/cmu-phil/py-tetrad.git

Place a copy of tetrad-current.jar in the resources folder.

Some notes on installing java on windows without admin

https://javafar.com/java-install-no-admin-rights/

For adding dgraph_flex

git clone https://github.com/kelvinlim/dgraph_flex.git

On macstudio, did

brew install openjdk@21

If you need to have openjdk@21 first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@21/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

sudo ln -sfn /opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@21/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-21.jdk

## Installing a portable version of jdk

Creating a portable version of the Java SDK 21 for Windows involves downloading the JDK as a ZIP file and setting it up in a way that doesn't require installation. Here are the steps:

1. **Download the JDK ZIP File**:

   - Go to the [Oracle JDK 21 download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk21-archive-downloads.html) or the [OpenJDK 21 download page](https://jdk.java.net/21/).
   - Download the ZIP file for Windows (e.g., `openjdk-21_windows-x64_bin.zip`).
2. **Extract the ZIP File**:

   - Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a directory where you have write permissions, such as `C:\Users\YourUsername\jdk-21`.
3. **Set Up Environment Variables Temporarily**:

   - Open Command Prompt and set the `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` variables for the current session:
     ```cmd
     set JAVA_HOME=C:\Users\YourUsername\jdk-21
     set PATH=%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%PATH%
     ```
   - These settings will only last for the duration of the Command Prompt session.
4. **Create a Batch File for Convenience**:

   - To avoid setting the environment variables every time, you can create a batch file (`set_java_home.bat`) with the following content:
     ```cmd
     @echo off
     set JAVA_HOME=C:\Users\YourUsername\jdk-21
     set PATH=%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%PATH%
     cmd
     ```
   - Double-clicking this batch file will open a new Command Prompt window with the environment variables set.
5. **Verify the Setup**:

   - In the Command Prompt, run:
     ```cmd
     java -version
     javac -version
     ```
   - This should display the version of Java and the Java compiler, confirming that the setup is correct.

By following these steps, you can create a portable version of JDK 21 that you can use without needing administrator privileges⁶[^10^].
